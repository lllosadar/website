        <p>
          Lisa was born in Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia. She is currently a PhD candidate at Lyles School of Civil
          Engineering. She obtained her bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at the National University of Colombia.
          She was a visiting scholar from the Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia group in the STSR group
          at Purdue University in 2015. She was awarded with the 2016 Best Civil Engineering Undergraduate Thesis Award
          by the National University with a thesis titled ‘A study to the influence of the implementation of mass
          transport system on land use’, which she developed during her time at Purdue. In 2017, she obtained her
          master’s in Civil Engineering from Purdue with the thesis ‘Exploring intercity passenger’s’ attitudes and
          loyalty to intercity passenger rail: Evidence from an on-board survey.’ Her research interests include
          transportation planning, accessibility, active travel, public health, transportation modeling and forecasting,
          rural transportation, and sustainability. In her free time, she likes to dance, watch documentaries, and do
          yoga.
