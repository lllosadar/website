        <h3>About Lisa</h3>
        <p>
          Lisa was born in Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia. She is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Toronto - Mobility Network.
          She obtained her bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
          She was a visiting scholar from the Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia group in the STSR group
          at Purdue University in 2015. She was awarded with the 2016 Best Civil Engineering Undergraduate Thesis Award
          by the National University with a thesis titled ‘A study to the influence of the implementation of mass
          transport system on land use’, which she developed during her time at Purdue. In 2017, she obtained her
          master’s in Civil Engineering from Purdue with the thesis ‘Exploring intercity passenger’s’ attitudes and
          loyalty to intercity passenger rail: Evidence from an on-board survey.’ Lisa earned her Ph.D. from Purdue University in May 2022.
          Her dissertation "Exploring the Relationship Between Transportation and Health Determinants in Rural America: An Empirical Study,"
          focused on a timely and rather complex topic. Although there has been much research on the link between transportation and health
          in urban areas, distant geographic locations such as rural areas have not received much attention. Understanding 
          the current impacts of the transportation system in rural areas is critical to recognize the key characteristics that
          might affect this population's health concerning the transportation changes that lie ahead. Her research interests include
          transportation planning, accessibility, active travel, public health, transportation modeling and forecasting,
          rural transportation, and sustainability. In her free time, she likes to dance, watch documentaries, and do
          yoga.
